Deviance, as a concept, refers to any behavior or characteristic that is considered to be outside of the norms or expectations of a particular group or society. Sociologists have sought to understand why certain behaviors are labeled as deviant, and how these labels are applied and maintained within societies. Early sociological theories of deviance were heavily influenced by the work of French sociologist Émile Durkheim, who argued that deviance is a normal and necessary aspect of any society. According to Durkheim, deviance serves to reinforce social norms and values\n",
